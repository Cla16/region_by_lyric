# region_by_lyric
A quick ML project to take rap lyrics and try to determine the rapper's area of origin

1. Create web scraper for lyric data # done! see GeniusIntegration.py
2. Create web scraper for location data # ended up not being necessary, data already available at http://rapworldmap.com
3. Build neural network to go lyric data -> region #WIP: Data reformating complete, need to write ML code and train model
